// Java operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables or values. These operators 
// are essential in programming as they allow you to manipulate data efficiently. They can be classified 
// into different categories based on their functionality. In this article, we 
// will explore different types of operators in Java, including arithmetic, unary, relational, 
// logical, and more, along with practical examples. 

class Operator {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 20;
    int sum = num1 + num2;

    System.out.println("The Sum is " + sum);

    int diff = num1 - num2;

    System.out.println("The Difference is " + diff);

    int a = 10;
    int b = 3;

    // Arithmetic operators on Strings
    String n1 = "15";
    String n2 = "25";

    // Convert Strings to integers
    int a1 = Integer.parseInt(n1);
    int b1 = Integer.parseInt(n2);

    System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));
    System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));
    System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));
    System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b));
    System.out.println("a % b = " + (a % b));
    System.out.println("a1 + b1 = " + (a1 + b1));

// Arithmetic Operators are used to perform simple arithmetic operations on
// primitive and non-primitive data types.
