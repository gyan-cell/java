// Java is different in that it does not compile the code into machine language code.
// Compilation creates bytecode out of the source code. Source code is written and stored in files with the extension of .java,
// and after compilation a file with a ".class" extension is created which contains 
// the bytecode instructions. Bytecode generally looks something like hello.class file 
public class hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World To java From Gyan...");
